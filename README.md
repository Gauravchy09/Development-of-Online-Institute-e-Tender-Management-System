🎓 Advanced DBMS Academic Project: Online Institute E-Tender Management System
This project is the development of an Online Institute E-Tender Management System, a web-based application designed to automate and digitize the tendering process within an academic institution.

The system serves as a centralized platform for administrators to create and publish tenders, and for registered vendors to securely submit bids electronically. It focuses on implementing advanced database concepts—such as rigorous transaction management (ACID properties), use of stored procedures for complex business logic, and query optimization techniques—to ensure data integrity, efficiency, and transparency in the crucial areas of bid evaluation and contract awarding.
